# Guest Reservation with OTP Verification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented OTP-based guest reservation functionality in the Flutter app. This allows users to make reservations without creating an account, using phone number verification via OTP (One-Time Password).

## Backend API Endpoints Used
The implementation uses the following existing backend endpoints:

1. **POST `/reservations/guest/request-verification`**
   - Sends OTP to guest's phone via WhatsApp
   - Rate-limited: 3 requests per 15 minutes per IP

2. **POST `/reservations/guest/verify-and-create`**
   - Verifies OTP and creates guest reservation
   - Requires: phone, otp, userName, barberId, serviceIds, date, startTime

## Changes Made

### 7. Code Generation
- Ran `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Generated `.g.dart` files for JSON serialization
- Generated `.freezed.dart` files for state management

## User Flow

### Guest Reservation Flow:
1. User selects services and date/time
2. On booking confirmation, clicks "Confirm Booking"
3. If not logged in, sees guest info dialog
4. User enters name and phone number
5. Clicks "Continue" → OTP is sent to phone via WhatsApp
6. OTP verification dialog appears
7. User enters 6-digit OTP code
8. On verification success, reservation is created
9. User is redirected to invoice screen

### Key Features:
- ✅ Phone number validation
- ✅ OTP sent via WhatsApp (backend)
- ✅ 5-minute OTP expiration timer
- ✅ Resend OTP functionality
- ✅ Real-time OTP validation (6 digits)
- ✅ Rate limiting (3 OTP requests per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Bilingual support (Arabic/English)
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Loading states and shimmer effects

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test guest reservation with valid OTP
- [ ] Test guest reservation with invalid OTP
- [ ] Test OTP expiration (5 minutes)
- [ ] Test resend OTP functionality
- [ ] Test rate limiting (3 requests per 15 minutes)
- [ ] Test phone number validation
- [ ] Test canceling guest info dialog
- [ ] Test canceling OTP dialog
- [ ] Test reservation for both time-slot and queue modes
- [ ] Test Arabic and English translations

## Important Notes

1. **No Backend Changes Required**: All backend endpoints already exist and are functional.

2. **OTP Delivery**: OTPs are sent via WhatsApp using the backend's WhatsApp integration.

3. **Security**: OTP verification is handled server-side. The app only collects and sends the OTP.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Backend enforces 3 OTP requests per 15 minutes per IP to prevent abuse.

5. **Queue Mode**: Current implementation focuses on time-slot reservations. Queue mode may need additional testing for guest users.
